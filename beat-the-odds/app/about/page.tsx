When I am lonely I feel like I get into a bad mental space and forget about important aspects of life I need to focus to stay disciplined and successful. But as a college student who is an upper-class man, it is hard to find coherent times to spend with your close ones due to everybody's varying schedules. That is why getting mental help is very important so you have somebody to speak to about your problems and other aspects by catering to your time to keep you on track and maintain a good mental well-being.\"",

It's not always easy, but I've learned firsthand how crucial it is to talk about mental health struggles and ask for help when needed. Despite the busyness of college life and the difficulty in trusting others, I've discovered the immense value in leaning on my family and seeking guidance from professionals who truly understand what I'm going through. While hitting the gym or going for a ride on my motorcycle provides temporary relief, I've learned that addressing my problems head-on is essential for long-term well-being. Despite having a small social circle, I'm committed to prioritizing self-care and actively seeking support when life feels overwhelming.",
