When I am lonely I feel like I get into a bad mental space and forget about important aspects of life I need to focus to stay disciplined and successful. But as a college student who is an upper-class man, it is hard to find coherent times to spend with your close ones due to everybody's varying schedules. That is why getting mental help is very important so you have somebody to speak to about your problems and other aspects by catering to your time to keep you on track and maintain a good mental well-being.\"",
